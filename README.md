## Setup your work environment

1. Clone the project - git clone https://github.com/dev4stechnologies/cruton-backend.git
2. Install node/npm packages - npm install
3. Create a .env in the root folder and add the required environment variables
4. Run the project - npm start

## Branching strategy

1. Create your feature branch from main branch ( not dev )
2. Raise the PR with your changes pointing to the dev branch as the base ( PR REVIEW )
3. Only when your task(jira ticket) is moved to done. Raise the PR pointing to the main branch again ( STAGING PR REVIEW )

## Environments vs Branches

1. dev - QA environment
2. main - Staging environment
